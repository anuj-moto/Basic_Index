		    <p style="background-color: aqua;">ProtoSell is a patent auction marketplace for high quality patented designs. We make it easy to sell your ideas. You can upload your patent
                documents to our website and watch buyers bid on your ideas. Buyers can browse our inventory and purchase the patents that best fit their needs.
              	ProtoSell is like EBay for patents, but better. Buyers bid for the patent or design and if it gets to a certain price you sell it. You also can
               	sell parts of a patent or design directly to other buyers. ProtoSell helps inventors make money by selling their designs and patents.
               	For the first time in history, it is possible for inventors to own what they create, monetize their intellectual property, fund future projects 
               	and operations through the sale of their ideas. For companies, Protosell creates liquidity in their valuable intellectual property by allowing them to 
               	share ownership of it.We move innovation to the marketplace by bringing buyers and sellers together. As a seller, you choose your price per item, 
               	receive anonymous bids from potential buyers and select the winning bid to complete the transaction. Whether you are planning to sell an early stage 
               	patent or looking to start a new business, ProtoSell gives you the ability to reach out to potential buyers before you make a major commitment.
               	We provide a user friendly interface for the design community, so they can easily search through our invention examples. Not only can you search for a 
               	patent or prototype by category, but you can search by keyword as well. The Prototypes Filter page allows users to search by name, designer, and even
                technology filed. The functionality of this site is to make patent searching easy for any user.
